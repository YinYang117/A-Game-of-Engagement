Everything that isn't part of the MVP

## Shopping

- Have a feature where the user can spend their gold from the game like shopping at amazon

    - Don't actually take their money
- Have a barter screen where you can "wheel and deal" with a shop
    - Sell your units, upgrades, etc
    - Gain more / different units, upgrades, etc

## Toggleable CSS

Have CSS effects like:
- Fireworks that spray from your mouse like a sparkler
- Light mode
- Dark mode
- A really big or really small mouse cursor
- Other cursor things
- Animations within the game
- Animations in the background
- Different styles of game board
- Maybe even a toggle from square to hex
    - This would be a Lot of backend game logic

## A Blog

A page on the site with posts from users.
- A user can open a post and reply with comments
- Comments can be filtered to show oldest first, or newest first
- No sub / nested comments

Why?

I'm envisioning a steam page for a game. A place where the community can come together and give direct feedback to the game devs (us). Also, where people who like the game can post about whatever they want.
Also it'd be another crud / feature to add to the list of our awesome site.
