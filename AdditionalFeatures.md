# Additional Features

Here we'll list out everything that isn't part of the MVP, or the main objective of the site, but may still be an interesting addition

## A Blog

A page on the site with posts from users.
- A user can open a post and reply with comments
- Comments can be filtered to show oldest first, or newest first
- No sub / nested comments

Why?

I'm envisioning a steam page for a game. A place where the community can come together and give direct feedback to the game devs (us). Also, where people who like the game can post about whatever they want.
Also it'd be another crud / feature to add to the list of our awesome site.
