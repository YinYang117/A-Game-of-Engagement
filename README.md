# A-Game-of-Engagement
An absolute jaw-dropper, eye-catching, eye-candy, beautiful, masterpiece of our resume / portfolio projects!

## The Site:
Ideas so far:
The very first screen engages the client by laying out a game before them with a scenario that they can't lose.

Idea is after a little engagement, you keep unlocking really cool features of the site, and you feel inspired to continue to spend more time on the site to see what's in store
Welcome splash either click out of the way or disappears animation to present the game
https://hex.frvr.com/ is a good reference for the board size, simplicity of the mvp, and the amount of effort to "unlock" the site.
It takes 2 click and drags, then the rest of the game is on you. We want about the same amount of time / interaction before the client is able to see every piece of the site, a little engagement.
Also in that game, the size of the single locked hex would be the size for each of us to have:
- an Icon or face picture for the button
- Each of us has our own onHover effect for the button, and click animation details
- Each of us gets a modal the same witdth, and about 80% - 100% height for us
- Customize the css that make each of us stand out with our own personality in the way we use our modal, like a canvas to paint on
- Detail a bio / pitch, links to our stuff, why you should hire me, etc

The game will be a simple auto battler. Think automatic chess where all the pieces move once before moving the same piece twice
Start with the equivelent of a pawn for the MVP. More details later.

Playing or interacting with the website allows the client to unlock more cool features.
Examples include a trail of happy shooting stars that shoots out of the mouse cursor
A moving background
Toggleable animations for button hovers and clicks
