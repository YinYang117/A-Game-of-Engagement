# A-Game-of-Engagement
An absolute jaw-dropper, eye-catching, eye-candy, beautiful, masterpiece of our resume / portfolio projects!

## The Site:
Ideas so far:
The very first screen engages the client by laying out a game before them with a scenario that they can't lose.
After playing a round, the site "unlocks" and you get access to all of the page, the nav, footer, profile links, and gameplay interactions

The game will be a simple auto battler. Think automatic chess where all the pieces move once before moving the same piece twice
Start with the equivelent of a pawn for the MVP. More details later.

Playing or interacting with the website allows the client to unlock more cool features.
Examples include a trail of happy shooting stars that shoots out of the mouse cursor
A moving background
Toggleable animations for button hovers and clicks

Our profiles can be selected from a menu or dropdown, or footer or something.
When you select one of our profiles, you'll see a modal pop up of that programmer.
Each of us customizes our own modal of a profile picture, little bio / why you'd want to hire me, and links to our other stuff like our linked in / facebook
Mainly, customizing the cool css effects that make each of us stand out with our own personality in the way we use our modal, like a canvas to paint on
*Side note, these should all be the same size modal background. Effects that go off the page / modal not included, just the main background content so we all look the same size.

Idea is after a little engagement, you keep unlocking really cool features of the site, and you feel inspired to continue to spend more time on the site to see what's in store
