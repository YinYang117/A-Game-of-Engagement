An absolute jaw-dropper, eye-catching, eye-candy, beautiful, masterpiece of our resume / portfolio projects!

## The Site:

Welcome splash screen greets the user. Either click to dismiss, or the animation plays out and the game is presented.

Users unlock more features of the site and game through playing.

https://hex.frvr.com/ is a good reference for the board size and simplicity of the mvp. Also, the size of the single locked hex is a good size for each developer to have:
- an Icon or picture button
- personalized onHover effect and click animation details
- a modal 
- customized css that stands out
- bio with links to our stuff
