A surefire answer to your hiring decision!

## The Site:

### Welcome page

Landing page with a lot of animation.

This page tells the background of the project, how it started, stopped, started again, and evolved through the process.

As the user scrolls down the main page, there's a lot of fun css based off scroll that plays out like a mini-movie or non-interactive game. IE a mario or mega man type character jumping across the top of the screen, falling, climbing down ladders, shooting stuff across to the other side, etc. It's fun and makes you want to continue to scroll down even if you stopped reading. (Goes in reverse when scrolling up? Open to alternatives.)

### Commit Page

This page is an insight into github without ever leaving the page.

Styling will be similar to actual github commits page, but not quite as it will also look at (or at least have screen shots of) issues, kanban board, and merges.

Using githubs api we will pull a recent list of issues, kanban cards, merge requests, and most prominently the commits. These will be live populated onto our page, and update in real time as work continues on the site.

This page displays our github activity like trophies, or a glimpse through a window into our work history. 
It also tells the story of what we had to do to make the page work, why we added it, something else, etc.

### The origonal game idea?

Simple hex or square grid game like chess (kinda) where players save their progress on their account (or more likely for them: the demo acocunt).

### Some kind of store?

A coin based store for the game? Or an example of a real world money transaction and storefront of some kind for displaying of those skills (especially exact number amounts without rounding errors losing pennies or more).
